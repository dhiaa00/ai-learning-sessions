# ByteCraft AI Team - Learning Resources

Welcome to the learning resources repository for the ByteCraft AI Team! This is a central hub where you can find all the materials, slides, and files from our weekly AI learning sessions.

## How to Use This Repo

### 1. View the Files
You can browse the files directly on GitHub to access the resources. Each week's session will have its own folder containing the relevant materials.

### 2. Download the Files
If you want to download the files, you have a few options:

1. **Download the Entire Repo**: Click the green "Code" button above and select "Download ZIP" to get all the files at once (button at the top).
2. **Download Individual Files**: You can click on a specific file, then click the "Download" button to get that file (button at the top).

### 3. Clone the Repo (Advanced)
If you're comfortable using Git, you can clone the repository to your local machine. This allows you to easily update your local copy as new sessions are added.

1. Install Git on your computer if you haven't already: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repo.
3. Run the following command: git clone https://github.com/dhiaa00/ai-learning-sessions.git
4. Now you can `cd` into the `bytecraft-ai-resources` folder and access all the files.

Let me know if you have any questions or need help getting started!
